 This install applies to "Workbench 1.3" © 1987 Amiga Inc..

 Requirements:
 -------------
 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 1 MB ChipMem and 1.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing F10 (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate message.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.


 Features:
 ---------
 This installs the Workbench under WHDLoad. It installs the Workbench and the
 Extras disk. You may add other software manually by copying it to the
 installation directory.
 There are different releases of the 1.3 Workbench disk. If you have "original
 and unmodified" disk with an unsupported name please contact me so that I can
 adjust the install script.
 After installation you should manually edit the startup-sequence of the
 installed workbench to remove programs which create access faults or make
 other problems.
 Known problems:
 - SetPatch causes access fault: uncomment it from the startup-sequence, the
   patches are already included in the Slave so there is no need for it
 - SetClock Load causes access fault: uncomment it from the startup-sequence,
   the Slave will take over the system time from host Amiga, so there is no
   need for it
