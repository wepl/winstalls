Generic WHDLoad KickEmu Starter by JOTD, Wepl

Can be used to run programs/demos/games using WHDLoad's kickstart
emulation. This may work with some programs if they are compatible 
enough.

Usage:

Copy the stuff you like to start into the data directory.
Use option Custom to specify which executable with possible arguments 
should be started.

Example:

WHDLoad GenericKick13.slave PRELOAD CUSTOM="program argument1 argument2 etc..."

Or if you use an icon from the workbench:

SLAVE=GenericKick13.slave
PRELOAD
CUSTOM=madnessII

With the archive and the explanation, all persons who want to test can do
that now. Maybe the generickick will be expanded, as the source are on the
archive. So you may also assemble other Slaves with different memory settings.
