 That install applies to "North & South" © 1989 Infogrames.

 That install requires WHDLoad and DIC to be in the path. Both can be found in
 the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select Expert as installation
 mode.

 You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
 You can quit the game by pressing F10 (key can be changed with Tooltype
 "QuitKey=").

 The game requires a installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 a appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick343.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try first to get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad's WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also doesn't succeeds inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad's WWW-Page.
