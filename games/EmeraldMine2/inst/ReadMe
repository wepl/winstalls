That patch applies to Emerald Mine 2 (c) 1988 Kingsoft.

This install has the slave-version 0.9.
It needs WHDLoad16 or higher in the path (eg in c:).

Fixed:  CPU dependend loops.
        Interrupt acknowledge (fixing a hangup after title screen).
        Due a programming fault, a few random instructions were overwritten
          when completing a level, leading to strange effects in the game.

Note:   One version is supported (IPF1520). The version of the Emerald
          Mines CD is the same (copy it from the "_OLD_EM/2/" directory
          to a disk named "Emerald Mine II" if you want to install it).
        To install this you need your game disk.
        Please be patient while creating the highscore files, the installer
          will flicker during this.
        There will be a question at installation if you want to install
          your playfield disk.
        There are still some time dependend loops in the editor, 
          but I have to look further how to fix this.

History: V0.9 - 2012-jun-23 Initial slave version.

The install is tested on an 18 MB 68030 and on E-UAE.
It needs 896 kB Chipmem, 256 kB arbitrary memory and additionally 800 kB
  for preload.
