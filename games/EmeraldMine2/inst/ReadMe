That patch applies to Emerald Mine 2 (c) 1988 Kingsoft.

It needs WHDLoad version 20.0 or higher in the path (eg in c:).

Fixed:  CPU dependend loops.
        Interrupt acknowledge (fixing a hangup after title screen).
        Due a programming fault, a few random instructions were overwritten
          when completing a level, leading to strange effects in the game.
        Level 73 diamond count corrected, it was previously unsolvable. 
          Either reinstall or copy the file 73 to data/pla/

Note:   One version is supported (IPF1520). The version of the Emerald
          Mines CD is the same (copy it from the "_OLD_EM/2/" directory
          to a disk named "Emerald Mine II" if you want to install it).
        To install this you need your game disk.
        There will be a question at installation if you want to install
          your playfield disk.
        Random generator took values from the Kickrom, replaced and stone
          pushing probability adapted to original generator. Please file
          a bug report if a stone pushing level is still impossible, or
          if another random dependend behaviour is weird.
        There are still some time dependend loops in the editor, 
          but I have to look further how to fix this.
