That patch applies to Emerald Mine (c) 1987 Kingsoft.

It needs WHDLoad 20 or higher in the path (eg in c:).
Supported versions are IPF1525 and the version on the Emerald Mines CD
(in _OLD_EM/1/ - to install copy the files in that dir to a disk named
"EMERALD MINE").

Fixed:  CPU dependend loops.
        Due a programming fault, a few random instructions were overwritten
          when completing a level, leading to strange effects in the game.
        Random generator took values from the Kickrom, replaced and stone
          pushing probability adapted to original generator. Please file
          a bug report if a stone pushing level is still impossible, or
          if another random dependend behaviour is weird.

History: V1.0 - 2012-nov-24 Initial slave version.

Version 1.1 2025-12-15 done by Wepl:
