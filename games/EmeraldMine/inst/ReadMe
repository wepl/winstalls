That patch applies to Emerald Mine (c) 1987 Kingsoft.

This install has the slave-version 1.0.
It needs WHDLoad16 or higher in the path (eg in c:).
Supported versions are IPF1525 and the version on the Emerald Mines CD
(in _OLD_EM/1/ - to install copy the files in that dir to a disk named
"EMERALD MINE").

Fixed:  CPU dependend loops.
        Due a programming fault, a few random instructions were overwritten
          when completing a level, leading to strange effects in the game.
        Random generator took values from the Kickrom, replaced and stone
          pushing probability adapted to original generator. Please file
          a bug report if a stone pushing level is still impossible, or
          if another random dependend behaviour is weird.

History: V1.0 - 2012-nov-24 Initial slave version.

The install is tested on an 18 MB 68030 and on E-UAE.
It needs 896 kB Chipmem, 256 kB arbitrary memory and additionally 800 kB
  for preload.
