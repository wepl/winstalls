That patch applies to Emerald Mine 3 Professional (c) 1990 Kingsoft.

This install has the slave-version 1.0.
It needs WHDLoad16 or higher in the path (eg in c:).
Supported versions are IPF2707 and the version on the Emerald Mines CD
(in _OLD_EM/3/ - to install copy the files in that dir to a disk named
"EMERALD MINE"). The version on IPF2185 has a corrupt disk structure and
cannot be supported for that reason. The version which has a freezed
executable can also not be supported because it contains many references
into the Kickstart 1.3 ROM.

Fixed:  CPU dependend loops.
        Due a programming fault, a few random instructions were overwritten
          when completing a level, leading to strange effects in the game.
        Random generator took values from the Kickrom, replaced and stone
          pushing probability adapted to original generator. Please file
          a bug report if a stone pushing level is still impossible, or
          if another random dependend behaviour is weird.

History: V1.0 - 2012-jul-15 Initial slave version.
         V1.1 - 2012-jul-21 Emerald Mines CD version supported.

The install is tested on an 18 MB 68030 and on E-UAE.
It needs 896 kB Chipmem, 256 kB arbitrary memory and additionally 800 kB
  for preload.
