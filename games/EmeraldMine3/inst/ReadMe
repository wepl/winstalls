That patch applies to Emerald Mine 3 Professional (c) 1990 Kingsoft.

It needs WHDLoad version 20 or higher in the path (eg in c:).
Supported versions are IPF2707 and the version on the Emerald Mines CD
(in _OLD_EM/3/ - to install copy the files in that dir to a disk named
"EMERALD MINE"). The version on IPF2185 has a corrupt disk structure and
cannot be supported for that reason. The version which has a freezed
executable can also not be supported because it contains many references
into the Kickstart 1.3 ROM.
"Emerald Mine 3 Professional" is identical to "Emerald Mine" only the
levels are different.

Fixed:  CPU dependend loops.
        Due a programming fault, a few random instructions were overwritten
          when completing a level, leading to strange effects in the game.
        Random generator took values from the Kickrom, replaced and stone
          pushing probability adapted to original generator. Please file
          a bug report if a stone pushing level is still impossible, or
          if another random dependend behaviour is weird.

History: V1.0 - 2012-jul-15 Initial slave version.
         V1.1 - 2012-jul-21 Emerald Mines CD version supported.
